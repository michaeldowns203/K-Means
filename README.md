I collaborated on this repository with my partner Max Hymer. It includes our implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbor, Edited K-Nearest Neighbor, and K-Means Clustering algorithms 
along with a design document we created before starting the project and a final paper covering the results of the experiments we performed with the algorithms.
